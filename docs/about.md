[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) helps you to automate workflows, it's a free [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)/[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) alternative for developers. With [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow), you can connect your favorite apps, data, and APIs, receive notifications of actions as they occur, sync files, collect data, and more. , We implemented it based on [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you use a YAML file (The configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow)) to build your workflows. If you have already written a [Github actions file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), it's really easy to define an Actionsflow workflow file, and you can use any [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) as your job's steps.

I started this project because I need to watch some RSS and do something, but I can't found a free platform that supports complicated workflows. I want to thank Github providing a totally free CI platform [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for open source project, so I can do some work to provide an easy way for the workflow that Github actions not support yet.
