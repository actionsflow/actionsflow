## 😁 About

[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) helps you automate workflows - it's a free [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)/[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) alternative for developers. With [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) you can connect your favorite apps, data, and APIs, receive notifications of actions as they occur, sync files, collect data, and more. We implemented it based on [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you use a YAML file to build your workflows. The configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), which makes it easy for you to get going if you've explored Github actions before. You can also use any [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) as your job's steps.

You can learn more about the core concepts of Actionsflow [here](#-how-actionsflow-works).

> If you want a lighter, simpler workflow that doesn't rely on Github Actions, consider [Denoflow](https://github.com/denoflow/denoflow), another workflow tool made by me, based on Deno with YAML , you can try it at an [online playground](https://playground.owenyoung.com/)

## 🔥 Features

- **Totally Free!** Actionsflow is based on [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). To run an Actionsflow workflow, all you need to do is [create a repository from the Actionsflow template repository](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate), or, you can also [deploy a self-hosted version](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/self-hosted).
- **Leverage Community Triggers**. You can use [community-provided triggers](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/triggers/#triggers-list) like Slack, RSS, Webhook, Typeform, Email, Reddit, NPM, Telegram, Twitter, etc. You can also easily [create your own triggers](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/creating-triggers/).
- **Support Almost ALL Actions of [Github Actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)**. Actionsflow uses [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) (a tool for running GitHub Actions locally) to run the jobs on your workflow file. With [these awesome Github actions](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/actions/), you can connect with IFTTT, Zapier, or other services like Slack, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, Line, etc.
- **Support Self-Hosted** You can run Actionsflow based on both GitHub Repository or [a self-hosted version](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/self-hosted).
- **Simple Workflow Configuration**. The Actionsflow configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow). If you've written a [Github actions file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) before, you'll find defining an Actionsflow workflow file really easy.
- **Run triggers every 5 minutes**. The workflow can check and run every 5 minutes based on [Github actions scheduled events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events).
- **Support complex workflows**. With Actionsflow you can make complex advanced workflows. Actionsflow provides a [MongoDB query language](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/#ontriggerconfigfilter) for you to filter your data as you want.

## 🎓 Documentation

Full documentation for Actionsflow lives [on the website](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/).

You can also [view it on Github](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow/blob/main/docs/index.md) if you prefer.

## 👀 How Actionsflow works

Actionsflow uses [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)' [**`repository_dispatch` event**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch) and [**`scheduled` event**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) every 5 minutes to run [Actionsflow triggers](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/triggers/). Those triggers generate result **items**, which are cached and deduplicated, generating a standard Github actions workflow file with the trigger result. Finally, the workflows are executed using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) (a tool for running GitHub Actions locally).

To learn more about how Actionsflow works, please see [Core Concepts of Actionsflow](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/concepts/).

## 🏁 Getting Started

> For self-hosted version please see [here](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/self-hosted)

1. **Create a public Github repository by using [this link](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate).**

   A typical Actionsflow repository structure looks like this:

   ```sh
   ├── .github
   │   └── workflows
   │       └── actionsflow.yml
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── README.md
   └── workflows
   │   └── rss.yml
   │   └── webhook.yml
   └── package.json
   ```

1. **Uncomment `.github/workflows/actionsflow.yml` schedule event**

   ```yml
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
   ```

   > Note: To prevent abuse, by default, the schedule is commented, please modify the schedule time according to your own needs, the default is once every 15 minutes. Learn more about schedule event, please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

1. **Create your [workflow files](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/) inside the `workflows` directory**

   A typical workflow file `rss.yml` looks like this:

   ```yaml
   on:
     rss:
       url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=300&count=3
   jobs:
     request:
       name: Make a HTTP Request
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Make a HTTP Request
           uses: actionsflow/axios@v1
           with:
             url: https://hookb.in/VGPzxoWbdjtE22bwznzE
             method: POST
             body: |
               {
                 "link":"${{ on.rss.outputs.link }}", 
                 "title": "${{ on.rss.outputs.title }}",
                 "content":"<<<${{ on.rss.outputs.contentSnippet }}>>>"
               }
   ```

   For more information about the Actionsflow workflow file, see the
   [Actionsflow workflow reference](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/workflow/).

   You can find examples and inspiration on the [Trigger List](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/triggers/) and on [Awesome Actionsflow Workflows](https://github.com/actionsflow/awesome-actionsflow).

1. **Commit and push your updates to Github**

Pushing to Github makes Actionsflow run the workflows you defined. You can view logs at your repository's actions tab on [Github](https://github.com).

For more information about getting up and running, see [Getting Started](https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/getting-started/).
